# Movie Sorter

I was browsing through a site that sells digital movie codes and there was no option to sort. This site was built with Wix. I wanted to sort by price. I'm not going to spend $50 for the James Bond Collection. I want to see the cheap seats!

The string assigned to the 'movies_list' variable is a sample of the actual site I was visiting, with URLs changed, for some reason. Similar to when you're looking at used cars and the people posting cover up the license plate, as if it's not visible to every single person on the street, I have hidden the identity of this website.

## Run This Script

1. Clone the repo to your pc.

    `git clone https://github.com/ticet11/movie_sorter.git`
2. Install packages.

    `npm install`
3. Run the script!

    `node movie_sorter`

You should see the unsorted prices, printed to the console, followed by the sorted prices.
